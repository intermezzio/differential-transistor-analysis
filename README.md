# Circuits Lab 7
This is the seventh lab in my Introduction to Microelectronic Circuits class at Olin College. This lab studies the behavior of a differential pair of circuits.  

## File Structure
The data folder has text output from LTSpice experiments. All of the python scripts to generate plots are in the root directory.

## Usage
This series of scripts depends on Python3, as well as numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and pandas. All required packages are in the `requirements.txt` file.
